        <h1>About the experience</h1>
        <p>Prior to COVID, I had started doing a bit of boxing for cardio and exercise. Once the gym closed down, I really missed the workout and eventually decided to create a VR experience that would help fill the gap. 
            
            <br>
            If you're new to boxing workouts, I'd recommend 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF-Xg62jf98&list=PL0EVvN39_Qt6ocSMP_y4fmFbTWJtrjL4s" target="_blank">
                this YouTube playlist</a> as a great place to start. Not everything there is relevant to this VR experience, 
                but the videos cover all the basic things like stance, the different punches that you'll throws, footwork, etc. 
                and has suggestions for different routines you can work through.
        </p>
            <h1>Developer notes</h1>
        <p>
            Building VR experiences on the web has its challenges, but there are a lot of great tools, libraries, and assets out there if you know where to look. Here are some of the things I used to build this experience:
            <ul>
                <li><a href=https://threejs.org target="_blank">THREE.js</a> - a feature-rich 3D renderer and pretty much the de facto standard for 3D on the web.</li>
                <li><a href=https://github.com/Jam3/three-bmfont-text target=_blank>three-bmfont-text</a> - a nice little library for rendering bitmap-based fonts (including support for signed distance field (SDF, MSDF) textures, which creates much sharper text outlines in VR. Note: I had to fix the MSDF shader to make it work with WebGL2.</li>
                <li><a href=https://msdf-bmfont.donmccurdy.com/ target=_blank>MSDF Font Generator</a> - a web-based tool for generated Multi-channel Signed Distance Field bitmap fonts.</li>
                <li><a href=https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal target=_blank>Basis Universal Texture Compression</a> - a texture compression tool that gives much smaller texture file sizes while still maintaining good quality. Not so great for compressing normal maps, but works great for diffuse textures and lightmaps.</li>
                <li><a href=https://blender.org target=_blank>Blender</a> - a fantastic and free 3D modeling and rendering tool. I avoided Blender for years because the UI in early versions of it (from 10 years ago) traumatized me, but it's gotten so much better. I'm really glad I gave it another try!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download" target=_blank>Fesliyan Studios Free Sound Effects</a> - lots of great sound effects here, including a bunch of punching and hitting sounds (which were particularly relevant for this experience).</li>
                <li><a href=https://cc0textures.com/ target=_blank>CC0 Textures</a> - a great source for high-quality PBR materials. The floor textures (diffuse, normal map, roughness map) I used came from here.
                <li><a href=https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/ovr-metrics-tool/ target=_blank>Oculus OVR Metrics Tools</a> - I work at Oculus, so I'm probably a bit biased towards VR on Quest headsets. If you're developing for Quest, this tool provides a great heads-up display of framerate, memory, etc. and is helpful when debugging performance issues or just to validate that you're maintaining a steady framerate.</li>
